# **Project Title:** Finisher of Boston Marathon 2015, 2016 & 2017

## **Team Members:**
* Edward Chen
* Thomas Nakamoto
* Eric Song
* Crystal (Shenyan) Huang

## **Project Description/Outline:**

The original data set contains the name, age, gender, country, city and state (where available), times at 9 different stages of the race, expected time, finish time and pace, overall place, gender place and division place (of 25000+ participants in the annual Boston Marathon). The project will mainly focus on applying descriptive analysis on the existing dataset. And further, by examining historical data, patterns or relationship can be discovered, where a predictive analysis can be draw from there. 

## **Research Questions to Answer:**

### **Performance Analysis**
-[Regression Analysis on Bib# vs finished time](https://github.com/Tom2shoes/betterthangroup5/tree/master/01%20Bib%20Analysis)  
-[Pace progression elite vs normal](https://github.com/Tom2shoes/betterthangroup5/tree/master/02%20Pacing%20Analysis)  
-[Experience factor to overall performance](https://github.com/Tom2shoes/betterthangroup5/tree/master/03%20Runner%20Experience%20Analysis)

## **Data Sets to be Used:**
-Boston Marathon data from Kaggle:  
Scraped from the official marathon [website](https://www.kaggle.com/rojour/boston-results/home)
